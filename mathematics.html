            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                From an early age, I developed a strong foundation in mathematics during grade school,
                where I consistently excelled in problem solving and logical reasoning.
                My interest in analytical thinking grew through advanced coursework and academic challenges,
                which gave me the skills to explain mathematical concepts clearly and effectively.
                I later pursued a degree in Software Engineering,
                where I strengthened not only my technical expertise but also my ability to apply mathematical principles to real-world problems.
                Throughout my studies, I gained experience in both individual and collaborative learning environments,
                further developing my communication skills and my ability to guide others through complex material.
                Today, I bring together my background in mathematics and software engineering to provide tutoring that is both practical and engaging.
                My goal is to help students build confidence, understand concepts deeply, and see how math connects to the world around them.
