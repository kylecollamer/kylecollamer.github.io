        My academic background is rooted in a rigorous Software Engineering curriculum that balanced theoretical science with hands-on development. I built a deep foundation in the full software lifecycle. This is from initial design and analysis to verification and long-term maintenance. Beyond the code, the program emphasized high-level problem solving, collaborative team dynamics, and professional communication, all of which I applied during a year-long senior capstone project.

                    <p>During my time in SWENG 311, I focused on building scalable systems through structured engineering strategies and object-oriented principles. I gained hands-on experience with the entire development lifecycle, including the design, documentation, testing, and construction of software. By using modeling tools like UML, I learned how to visualize complex architectures before implementing them in major object-oriented languages. This approach taught me how to apply proven design patterns to mid-sized systems to ensure the code remains clean and maintainable.</p>
