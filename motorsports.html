              In the 2025 Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio (Round 10 of the season, July 6, 2025), Scott Dixon secured his first win of the year — and a record-extending seventh victory at Mid-Ohio — by executing a two-stop fuel-saving strategy and passing his Chip Ganassi teammate Álex Palou in the closing laps after Palou ran wide. Palou, who led 75 laps, held on for second and extended his points lead, while Christian Lundgaard completed the podium in third.The race was relatively clean, with just two caution periods, and notable efforts came from Colton Herta (4th) and Pato O’Ward (5th).
