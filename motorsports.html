              In the 2025 Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio (Round 10 of the season, July 6, 2025), Scott Dixon secured his first win of the year — and a record-extending seventh victory at Mid-Ohio — by executing a two-stop fuel-saving strategy and passing his Chip Ganassi teammate Álex Palou in the closing laps after Palou ran wide. Palou, who led 75 laps, held on for second and extended his points lead, while Christian Lundgaard completed the podium in third.The race was relatively clean, with just two caution periods, and notable efforts came from Colton Herta (4th) and Pato O’Ward (5th).

              The 2025 Sahlen’s Six Hours of The Glen was held on June 22, 2025 at Watkins Glen International as the sixth round of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and the third event of the Michelin Endurance Cup. Rain-soaked conditions and six full-course cautions rattled the early stages, with Felipe Nasr in the No. 7 Porsche seizing the lead from 10th on the grid in the initial laps. As the race unfolded, the race took heavy tolls on several championship contenders—most notably Nick Tandy, who crashed in lap 126 after losing control of his Porsche 963. Ultimately, the victory went to the Acura ARX-06 of Tom Blomqvist and Colin Braun, marking back-to-back wins for Acura in IMSA’s top class.
