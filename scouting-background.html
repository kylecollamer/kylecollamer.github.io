                <p>
                    The scouting program has been a vital part of my life since I joined the program as a six year old in 2008.
                    My leadership philosophy, life skills, and passions are fueled by this program.
                    The following sections detail my involvment, experiences, and lessons learned through my continued time in the program.
                </p>

                <h2 id="cub-scouts">Early Scouting Journey</h2>
          <p>I began my Scouting journey in <strong>2008</strong> as a Cub Scout in <strong>Pack 213</strong> in <strong>Murrysville, Pennsylvania</strong>. In <strong>2013</strong>, I joined <strong>Troop 205</strong>, where I advanced through the program and embraced a variety of leadership opportunities. I completed <strong>National Youth Leadership Training</strong> in <strong>2014</strong>, which served as the foundation for many of my future roles.</p>

          <h2 id="oa-involvement">Order of the Arrow Involvement</h2>
          <p>In <strong>2015</strong>, I was inducted into the <strong>Order of the Arrow</strong>, becoming a member of <strong>Wagion Lodge Number 6</strong>. I became a <strong>Brotherhood Member</strong> in <strong>2016</strong> and was honored with the <strong>Vigil Honor</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>. Since <strong>2016</strong>, I have been a member of the <strong>Lodge Executive Committee</strong>, and I continue to serve in that capacity.</p>

          <h2 id="lodge-leadership">Lodge Leadership Roles</h2>
          <p>I served as <strong>Activities Chairman</strong> during parts of <strong>2016</strong>, <strong>2017</strong>, and <strong>2018</strong>, and was <strong>Cub Scout Activity Chairman</strong> in <strong>2018</strong> and <strong>2019</strong>. In <strong>2019</strong>, I was elected <strong>Administrative Vice Chief</strong> and served during <strong>2020</strong> and <strong>2021</strong>. I currently serve as the <strong>Unit Elections Advisor</strong>, following my time as the <strong>Unit Elections Chairman</strong> beginning in <strong>2022</strong>.</p>

          <h2 id="adult-leadership">Training and Adult Leadership</h2>
          <p>In <strong>2017</strong>, I joined the <strong>National Youth Leadership Training Staff</strong> as a <strong>Troop Guide</strong>. I returned to staff in <strong>2023</strong> as an <strong>Adult Leader</strong>, and became the <strong>Scoutmaster</strong> in <strong>2024</strong>, a role I continue to hold. I became an <strong>Assistant Scoutmaster</strong> in <strong>2020</strong> and remain active with <strong>Troop 205</strong>. In <strong>2021</strong>, I completed <strong>Wood Badge</strong>, the highest level of adult training in Scouting.</p>

          <h2 id="faith">Faith-Based Service</h2>
          <p>I also serve the <strong>Diocese of Greensburg</strong> as a <strong>Catholic Religious Emblems Counselor</strong>, guiding Scouts in earning the <strong>Ad Altare Dei</strong> and <strong>Pope Pius XII</strong> awards. I am a <strong>parishioner of Mount Saint Peter Parish</strong> in <strong>New Kensington</strong>, where faith and service are central parts of my life.</p>

          <h2 id="family">Family and Mentorship</h2>
          <p>One of the most meaningful parts of my current involvement in Scouting is being an <strong>older brother to a Life Scout</strong>, and sharing in his experiences in the <strong>Order of the Arrow</strong> and in troop leadership.</p>

          <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
          <p>I was accepted to <strong>Penn State University</strong> in <strong>2019</strong> and began my academic journey in <strong>2020</strong> at the <strong>New Kensington campus</strong>. I am finishing my degree through <strong>Penn State World Campus</strong> in <strong>May 2025</strong>, majoring in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Information Science and Technology</strong>. I also enjoy tutoring fellow students at <strong>Penn State New Kensington</strong> as a way of giving back to the faculty and the university community.</p>

          <h2 id="technical">Technical Skills</h2>
          <p>My technical experience includes programming in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Assembly</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, as well as web development and artificial intelligence fundamentals. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and continue learning.</p>

          <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
          <p>In my free time, I enjoy <strong>playing video games</strong>, especially sandbox games like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, where I create <strong>mods, plugins, and modpacks</strong>. I also enjoy following <strong>motorsports</strong>, especially <strong>Formula One</strong> and <strong>endurance racing</strong>.</p>

          <h2 id="philosophy">Leadership Philosophy</h2>
          <p>Through more than fifteen years in Scouting, I have developed a leadership philosophy rooted in preparation, responsibility, and servant leadership. These values influence every part of my life, from mentoring others to building software that solves real problems.</p>
