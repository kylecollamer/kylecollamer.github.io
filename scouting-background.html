            <section>
                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The scouting program has been a vital part of my life since I joined the program as a six year old in 2008.
                    My leadership philosophy, life skills, and passions are fueled by this program.
                    The following sections detail my involvment, experiences, and lessons learned through my continued time in the program.
                    I absolutely love this organization, so I hope that is conveyed in this section.
                </p>

                <h2 id="order-of-the-arrow">Order of the Arrow</h2>
                <p>
                    I was elected by my fellow Troop 205 scouts into the <strong>Order of the Arrow</strong> in 2015.
                    Thus, I completed the ordeal process and became an Ordeal member of <strong>Wagion Lodge #6</strong> in August of 2015.
                    This is one of the historic lodges of the country, being the second oldest existing lodge.
                    It was founded in <strong>1921</strong> by members associated with the original Order of the Arrow founders.
                    I was an active member for the next year and became a Brotherhood member during summer camp of 2016.
                    That fall, I was selected to be a member of the <strong>Lodge Executive Committee</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>Activities Chairman</h3>
                <p>
                    I was selected in August 2016 to become a member of the Lodge Executive Committee.
                    This is a prestigious position as you are a voting member and are a significant voice of the lodge.
                    I was fourteen years of age, making me one of the youngest chairman at the time.
                    Specifically, I was in charge of all lodge activities for the 2016 October Service Weekend.
                    I did not only have planning responsibilities as I had to manage a larger group of committee members
                        and work with an allocated budget.
                    Chairman in the Order of the Arrow are guided by an adult "advisor" and are managed by a "lodge officer".
                    Many of the scouts in my troop that I entered the lodge with became some of my closest and most reliable help.
                    After a very successful 2016 October event, I was selected by the next year's chief to retain the position for all of 2017.
                    In January of 2017, I participated in my first <strong>Lodge Leadership Development (LLD)</strong>.
                    This is an important training lead by the five "lodge officers" and guided by all of the adult advisors.
                    Overall, I planed the activities of our five lodge events throughout the year.
                    Specifically, they were our annual February banquet and our four weekends at Camp Conestoga in April, June, August, and October.
                    This was a formative experience in my scouting journey as I became a more recognized leader beyond my troop
                        and met some friends that I am still close with today.
                </p>
                <h3>Cub Activity Chairman</h3>
                <p>
                    For the 2018 lodge year, I was reassigned to be the <strong>Cub Activity Chairman</strong> (formally the Conservation Chairman).
                    This was a significant undertaking for me as I was responsible for planning an implementing my lodge's <strong>Spring Nature Walk</strong> event.
                    Essentially, this is a day camp at Camp Conestoga for Cub Scouts where upwards of three hundred people attend.
                    In the late winter, I traveled to the various <strong>Roundtable</strong> adult meetings and had to speak to packed rooms of adults about the event.
                    During the event, I had to speak to the large crowds and help navigate them in an activity round-robin format.
                    After a successful 2018 Spring Nature Walk, I was retained to be the chairman for the 2019 lodge year.
                    During these two years, I also filled in as my old role of Activities Chairman at a few events.
                </p>
                <h3>Vigil Honor</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2019, one of the most impactful moments of my life occured when I was selected to be a member of the <strong>Vigil Honor</strong>.
                    This honor, which is over one hundred years old, is designed a recognition of exceptional service, personal effort,
                        and unselfish interest that goes beyond the immediate responsibilities of a member.
                    I was recognized at the 2019 August Fellowship Weekend.
                    This was important to me as this honor inspired me to get more active in the program and made me more eager to make an impact on the lives of others.
                </p>
                <h3>National Leadership Seminar</h3>
                <p>
                    After being elected to the position of Administrative Vice Chief, I was selected to be a delegate to go to <strong>National Leadership Seminar (NLS)</strong>
                        at Camp Alpine, New Jersey across the river from New York City.
                    This is the second national program of emphasis I attended after the 2018 National Order of the Arrow Confrence.
                    NLS is a fantastic training program led by Order of the Arrow members throughout the country.
                    It is designed for lodge officers and expands upon the concepts of National Youth Leadership Training.
                </p>
                <h3>Administrative Vice Chief</h3>
                <p>
                    At the 2019 October Service Weekend, I was elected to be Wagion Lodge's <strong>Administrative Vice Chief (AVC)</strong> for 2020.
                    This is one of the five elected "officer" positions in the lodge.
                    For me, just getting up and giving a speech to my fellow members in the lodge was a significant life moment.
                    This position directly oversees the administrative division and works with their chairs informing budgetary requests.
                    This "division" of committees includes <strong>Unit Elections</strong>, <strong>Food Service</strong>, <strong>Service</strong>, and others.
                    I also acted as the lodge parliamentarian and was in charge of taking an annual inventory of all lodge property and assets.
                    A significant goal of mine in 2020 was to increase the amount of youth being elected into the Order of the Arrow, which was successful.
                    I successfully ran again for this position for the 2021 lodge year as well.
                </p>
                <h3>100th Anniversary</h3>
                <p>
                    The 2021 lodge year marked the 100th anniversary of Wagion Lodge.
                    I had the pleasure of being on of the five officers during that anniversary year.
                    In addition, our August weekend was turned into a large invitational event for past and present lodge members.
                    I reprised my role as <strong>Activities Chairman</strong> in addition to my responsibilities as Administrative Vice Chief.
                    This highly successful event had a significant turnout of over six hundred people.
                </p>
                <h3>Unit Elections Chairman</h3>
                <p>
                    After deciding to not run again for lodge office for 2022 with respect to my increasing educational committments,
                        I was selected for the role of <strong>Unit Elections Chairman</strong> for that year.
                    This was my last year as a youth (Order of the Arrow youth members are under 21), so I wanted to make one large final impact in the lodge.
                    I took it upon myself to completely overhaul many aspects of Unit Elections, where troops elect Order of the Arrow members
                        under the supervision of an external lodge visitation team.
                    This included new paperwork, a new tracking system, and a new committee structure.
                    I was honored to recieve the lodge's first "Chairman of the Year" award at the 2023 banquet,
                        which was on my 21st birthday.
                    This brought my six years as a youth Lodge Executive Committee member to an end.
                </p>
                <h3>Developing Youth Leadership Confrence</h3>
                <p>
                    In preparation to become an adult advisor, Wagion Lodge sent me to <strong>Developing Youth Leadership Confrence (DYLC)</strong> in March 2023.
                    This was my fourth national program of emphasis I attended.
                    DYLC is a follow up course from National Leadership Seminar meant for adult advisors.
                    The goal of this training is to strengthen an adviser's capacity to develop youth leadership within the lodge.
                </p>
                <h3>Unit Elections Advisor</h3>
                <p>
                    Eager to still be involved, I agreed to transition to the <strong>Unit Elections Advisor</strong> role for the 2023 lodge year.
                    This made me the youngest advisor at the time, technically becoming advisor as a youth member in the lodge for the first two months of the year.
                    Adult advising is very important to me as I enjoy still being involved in the lodge as a young adult.
                    I have been in this specific role since.
                </p>
                <h3>Section Conclaves</h3>
                <p>
                    I had the privilege of attending many section conclaves in my time as a lodge member.
                    Conclaves are events where multiple lodges within a "section" gather for fun, training, and fellowship.
                    The first conclave I attended was during 2017 at <strong>Camp Conestoga</strong>.
                    Since Wagion Lodge hosted this event, I was on staff helping set up, run, and clean up after the event.
                    In 2018, I attended my second conclave at <strong>Camp Heritage</strong> near Fairchance, PA.
                    The next conclave I attended was at Camp Conestoga in 2020. 
                    In 2021, during Wagion Lodge's 100th anniversary year, we had the privledge of hosting again at Camp Conestoga.
                    I attended my first conclave at <strong>Camp Buccoco</strong> in 2023 near Slippery Rock, PA.
                    I attended my second conclave at Camp Heritage in 2024.
                    In 2025, I went to conclave at <strong>Camp Seven Mountains</strong> near State College, PA.
                </p>
                <h3>National Order of the Arrow Confrence</h3>
                <p>
                    I had the privilege of attending three <strong>National Order of the Arrow Confrence (NOAC)</strong> events in my time as a member of the lodge.
                    NOAC events are confrence events where Order of the Arrow members around the world attend.
                    I have had the pleasure of being trained on a variety of topics about a large variety of topics.
                    The 2018 NOAC was the first national program of emphasis I attended. This was at Indiana State University in Bloomington, IN.
                    I was the first scout from my troop to attend this event in many years.
                    Unfortunately, the 2020 NOAC was cancelled so my next NOAC was in 2022.
                    This event was at Tennessee State University in Knoxville, TN. I throughly enjoyed this event as I knew many more people this time around.
                    Since I was a lodge officer between these two NOACs, I focused my trainings on adult advising.
                    The last NOAC I attended was in 2024 at the University of Colorado in Boulder, CO.
                    This was significant because this was my first trip out west and involved my first flight.
                    I focused my trainings on Unit Elections and lodge communication.
                    I intend on attending the 2027 NOAC that will be in University of Illinois in Champaign, IN.
