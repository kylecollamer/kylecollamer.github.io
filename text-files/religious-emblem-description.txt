The Ad Altare Dei and Pope Pius XII emblems are official religious awards of the Catholic Church, designed to help Scouts grow spiritually and explore their faith in a structured, supportive environment.

The Ad Altare Dei emblem is intended for Scouts in middle school or early high school and focuses on the seven sacraments as a way to deepen their understanding of God’s grace in their daily lives.

The Pope Pius XII emblem is for older high school Scouts and centers on vocations—married life, single life, religious life, and ordained ministry—encouraging participants to reflect on how God is calling them to live out their faith through service and leadership.

Both programs are recognized by the National Catholic Committee on Scouting and require regular participation, reflection, and completion of activities designed to integrate Catholic values into everyday life.

I am offering these emblems starting in August 2025 and ending in March 2026. Please reach out to me via t205kcollamer@gmail.com if you are interested.
