    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Kyle Collamer</strong>. I am an aspiring software developer with a strong interest in building purposeful and user friendly digital solutions. My journey has been shaped equally by a passion for technology and a lifelong commitment to leadership, service, and personal growth through Scouting.</p>

    <p>I began my Scouting journey in <strong>2008</strong> as a Cub Scout in <strong>Pack 213</strong> in <strong>Murrysville, Pennsylvania</strong>. In <strong>2013</strong>, I joined <strong>Troop 205</strong>, where I advanced through the program and embraced a variety of leadership opportunities. I completed <strong>National Youth Leadership Training</strong> in <strong>2014</strong>, which served as the foundation for many of my future roles.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2015</strong>, I was inducted into the <strong>Order of the Arrow</strong>, becoming a member of <strong>Wagion Lodge Number 6</strong>. I became a <strong>Brotherhood Member</strong> in <strong>2016</strong> and was honored with the <strong>Vigil Honor</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>. Since <strong>2016</strong>, I have been a member of the <strong>Lodge Executive Committee</strong>, and I continue to serve in that capacity.</p>

    <p>I served as <strong>Activities Chairman</strong> during parts of <strong>2016</strong>, <strong>2017</strong>, and <strong>2018</strong>, and was <strong>Cub Scout Activity Chairman</strong> in <strong>2018</strong> and <strong>2019</strong>. In <strong>2019</strong>, I was elected <strong>Administrative Vice Chief</strong> and served during <strong>2020</strong> and <strong>2021</strong>. I currently serve as the <strong>Unit Elections Advisor</strong>, following my time as the <strong>Unit Elections Chairman</strong> beginning in <strong>2022</strong>.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2017</strong>, I joined the <strong>National Youth Leadership Training Staff</strong> as a <strong>Troop Guide</strong>. I returned to staff in <strong>2023</strong> as an <strong>Adult Leader</strong>, and became the <strong>Scoutmaster</strong> in <strong>2024</strong>, a role I continue to hold. I became an <strong>Assistant Scoutmaster</strong> in <strong>2020</strong> and remain active with <strong>Troop 205</strong>. In <strong>2021</strong>, I completed <strong>Wood Badge</strong>, the highest level of adult training in Scouting.</p>

    <p>I also serve the <strong>Diocese of Greensburg</strong> as a <strong>Catholic Religious Emblems Counselor</strong>, guiding Scouts in earning the <strong>Ad Altare Dei</strong> and <strong>Pope Pius XII</strong> awards. I am a <strong>parishioner of Mount Saint Peter Parish</strong> in <strong>New Kensington</strong>, where faith and service are central parts of my life.</p>

    <p>One of the most meaningful parts of my current involvement in Scouting is being an <strong>older brother to a Life Scout</strong>, and sharing in his experiences in the <strong>Order of the Arrow</strong> and in troop leadership.</p>

    <p>I was accepted to <strong>Penn State University</strong> in <strong>2019</strong> and began my academic journey in <strong>2020</strong> at the <strong>New Kensington campus</strong>. I am finishing my degree through <strong>Penn State World Campus</strong> in <strong>May 2025</strong>, majoring in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Information Science and Technology</strong>. I also enjoy tutoring fellow students at <strong>Penn State New Kensington</strong> as a way of giving back to the faculty and the university community.</p>

    <p>My technical experience includes programming in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Assembly</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, as well as web development and artificial intelligence fundamentals. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and continue learning.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy <strong>playing video games</strong>, especially sandbox games like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, where I create <strong>mods, plugins, and modpacks</strong>. I also enjoy following <strong>motorsports</strong>, especially <strong>Formula One</strong> and <strong>endurance racing</strong>.</p>

    <p>Through more than fifteen years in Scouting, I have developed a leadership philosophy rooted in preparation, responsibility, and servant leadership. These values influence every part of my life, from mentoring others to building software that solves real problems.</p>
