        <h2>Why Earn Religious Emblems?</h2>
        <p>
          A Catholic Scout should consider earning religious emblems to grow in their faith, deepen their relationship with God,
          and better understand how Catholic values apply to daily life. These programs help Scouts explore their spiritual identity,
          connect with their parish community, and develop a stronger moral foundation.
          They also fulfill part of the Scout Law to be reverent and demonstrate a commitment to living out their faith in service and leadership.

        <h2>Religious Emblems Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Ad Altare Dei and Pope Pius XII emblems are official religious awards of the Catholic Church.
          These programs help Scouts grow spiritually and explore their faith in a structured, supportive environment.

        <h2>Earn Your Catholic Religious Emblem This Year</h2>
        <p>
          I offer the Ad Altare Dei and Pope Pius XII religious emblems from August to March on Thursday evenings at Mother of Sorrows from 6:00 to 8:00 PM.
          These programs help Catholic Scouts grow in their faith, learn more about the Church, and explore how to live out their beliefs in daily life.
          Ad Altare Dei focuses on the sacraments, while Pope Pius XII encourages discussion about vocations and moral decision making.
          Both emblems are an opportunity for Scouts to deepen their spiritual understanding and strengthen their connection to the Catholic community.
